![Ticket](./docs/ticket-snap.jpg)

## Learnings 

### Freshdesk SDK (https://developers.freshdesk.com/v2/docs/quick-start/)

- Data Methods 
- Instance Methods 
- Interface Methods  
- Product Events 
- Installation Parameters 


### Freshdesk API  (https://developers.freshdesk.com/api/)
Initialially used API instead of SDK to update tickets hence explored the API for creating and fetching Tickets 

### Notion API (https://developers.notion.com/reference/intro)


### - Crayons Library (https://crayons.freshworks.com/)
1. Custom Styled Components 

## Notes 

- Can not invoke interface methods from modal hence pass them back to parent and then invoke interface methods 
- instance methods can be used to send data between different instances modal <-> app 

## Future Scope
- Work on a Sync up tool which syncs notion pages with Solution Articles in Freshdesk
